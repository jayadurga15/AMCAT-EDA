# AMCAT-EDA
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset with a focus on understanding the key factors influencing salary as the target variable. Through EDA, the goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data, both at the individual and paired levels, using various statistical and visualization techniques. Additionally, the project will involve testing specific research questions, such as verifying salary-related claims for engineering graduates and exploring the relationship between gender and specialization. The findings will be documented in a comprehensive report, and the analysis will be submitted in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.
